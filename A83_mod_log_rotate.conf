    # Adds RotateLogs and supporting directives that allow logs to be rotated by
    # the server without having to pipe them through rotatelogs.
    # 
    # RotateLogs On|Off    Enable / disable automatic log rotation. Once enabled
    #                      mod_log_rotate takes responsibility for all log output
    #                      server wide even if RotateLogs Off is subsequently
    #                      used. That means that the BufferedLogs directive that
    #                      is implemented by mod_log_config will be ignored.
    RotateLogs On

    # RotateLogsLocalTime  Normally the log rotation interval is based on UTC.
    #                      For example an interval of 86400 (one day) will cause
    #                      the logs to rotate at UTC 00:00. When this option is
    #                      on, log rotation is timed relative to the local time.
    # 
    RotateLogsLocalTime On 

    # RotateInterval       Set the interval in seconds for log rotation. The
    #                      default is 86400 (one day). The shortest interval that
    #                      can be specified is 60 seconds. An optional second
    #                      argument specifies an offset in minutes which is
    #                      applied to UTC (or local time if RotateLogsLocalTime
    #                      is on). For example RotateInterval 86400 60 will
    #                      cause logs to be rotated at 23:00 UTC.
    RotateInterval 86400
